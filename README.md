# Submarine_cable_route

Finds the best path to send the data through submarine cables.

To run the code online - use Notebook.ipynb

We enter map data in text files. The algorithm finds the path.

Light travels at the fastest speed. We need not consider distance when finding route.
We need to consider number of nodes on the way, along with the existing traffic in the route.

### <ins> Abstract</ins>: 

  * We need to send data from our computer to a different server using the internet. It is sent to different countries through Submarine cables which are installed in the sea. The cables route about 99% of global internet traffic. These cables are also called Undersea cables.
  * There are many possible paths using which we can send data. Each cable has a different capacity and different amount of other traffic which is currently being sent.
Cable map is available on [the website](https://www.submarinecablemap.com/).

### <ins> Methodology</ins>: 

  We use a programming language to write code. We will use text files to input the cable capacity, location, and traffic data. We will implement a routing algorithm.

### <ins> Expected Outcome</ins>: 

  Using this project, we write an algorithm that finds the best path to send the data to the destination, with the minimum distance possible.
